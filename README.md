## Welcome to buiedev !!!  

_**The Github README page about its maintainer, M. Adam Buie (that's me)!**_

Currently, and probably foremoast, I am by know means a program, software designer, infrastructure architect, or any other extremely important person as I
do not how to code all that well -- yet!  This profile collection is more about my journey learning to code, the things I am able to do with the skills that 
I develop, and also place some of what I do professionally on exhibiit: Electronic Data Interchange X12 consulting and business and systems analysis.  I plan
on exhibiting some codde that I create, and as I am mostly intersted in cloud severless, distributed architecture, I am hoping to learn more about that as
well and hopefully have some work examples for you on that as well.

#### A Short Professional Summary About Me  

_Name:_ Matthew Adam Buie
_Profession:_ EDI Consultant  
_Favorite Tech Topics:_ 
  -Cloud/Distributed/Serverless Computing  
  -Datawarehousing and Master Data Management  
  -Electronic Data Interchange X12 Standard  
  -APIs and API Management  
_Neat Facts_: (with no real relavence other than it is fun to share!)  
 1. I was wanted to start a business, and though its a simple LLC, which I am not intersted in any way really of wanting to build a huge business, it is my LLC!
 2. Beginning in or around the 3rd or 4th grade, I was caught in a horrendous lightening stom with my maternal grandfather - I am terrified of storms to this day (nearly 20 years later).
 3. I may be passionate about technology, but one of my other extreme passions is history, chiefly that of The United Kingdom from 1066 on up until today (the whole history!)
  
#### Current Personal Goals    

**GOAL 1**: Learn Python in Order to Build Applications and Become an Awesome Programmer  
  
  Learn to program more in Python, and in a strutured way so that I have a in depth knowledge of programming, application development, 
  and the Pythonic language as a whole.  I am currently JUST a NOOB when it comes to Python, but having worked around so many different scenarios
  when it comes to development that learning a language was a lot loess frightening than I thought it would be.  Being able to design solid appli-
  cations in Python from top to bottom would be an absolutely amazing thing to learn and to do.  Though the end goals are purely motivated for no
  other reason than for the joy of learning and something I would personally like to do, I hope to be able to apply these skills in my professional
  life as well!  
  
**Goal 2**: Engage and Give Back to the Communities Like These  
  
  Participate and engage with different communities, from the Free and Open Source community, other professionals adding new skills to their toolbelt,
  soon-to-be amazing programmers and developers who, like myself, are just starting out on their development journeys.  I have always worked in a
  somewhat-to-very technofunctional position when it comes to Electronic Data Interchange, but being able to delve further into the technical side and
  finally enable myself to create the things that I ideate and come up with myself, but also become part of something larger than myself that I can
  hopefully one day give back to in ways that improve and life and work of others.

**Goal 3**:  Create Something New and (if not awesome) Useful  
  
  It would be kind of senseless to spend all of this time learning and trying to teach myself new things all in the name of just to learn it and then 
  do nothing with those new skills!  I want to be able to one day develop a process or create a program or even develop a framework that helps others
  in way that is able to enhance their lives.  If I can make my life easier, then all the more so the better; however, my true real goals and aims are
  always to make sure that whatever it is that I do, that I leave it better than when I found it and in a way that the next person is able to make use
  of for their own purposes.  
    
 #### What This Repository and Profile Contains  
 
 Stay tuned: I am still working out how to best use the site to demonstrate to everyone my skillsets that I currently have and the ones that I am
 working on developing now!  As it comes into focus to myself and to fruition, I will make sure to update this file with all the details!  
 
 
**NOTE**:  Currently not looking for additional clients or work at this time
